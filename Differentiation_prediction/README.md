Folder for the prediction of differentiation based on the transcriptome of H3K27me3-regulated genes. 

Includes the jupyter notebooks where the predictive models are built and tested, and reproduce the results presented in the paper. Also includes the required annotations (`tx_per_gene_annot.csv` to link transcripts and genes), `Supplementary_File_1.csv` to know which genes were regulated by H3K27me3, and `hipsci-cell-lines.csv` and `Supplementary_File_3.csv` for details about the HipSci lines used.
